# Overseas-Sales-Dashboard

## Project Overview: Overseas Product Sales Dashboard

The objective of this project is to provide the CEO with a comprehensive dashboard that offers insights into the overseas product sales data. The dataset includes information such as sales figures, customer details, country and region information, as well as target sales data, all presented in an Excel format.

To gain a holistic understanding of the data, I followed below steps.

#### First, we utilized the power of XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP functions to merge the data based on common key columns. This consolidation process allowed us to bring together relevant information from different sources, ensuring a unified and comprehensive dataset.

#### Next, we transformed the consolidated data into a pivot format to facilitate the analysis and reporting. By strategically selecting the necessary data points, we organized the information in a structured manner that would be conducive to generating meaningful insights. This step involved grouping the data according to specific requirements, such as sales figures, top products, and customer details, spanning the entire year.

#### Finally, leveraging the refined dataset, we crafted a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard. The dashboard serves as a one-stop solution, enabling the CEO to effortlessly grasp the overall sales performance, identify the top-selling products, and discern key customer trends. By presenting the company's sales data in a clear and intuitive format, the dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making.

Throughout the project, our focus remained on providing an easily digestible and actionable representation of the overseas product sales data. By employing advanced Excel functions, data manipulation techniques, and visualization principles, we aimed to empower the CEO with valuable insights and a comprehensive overview of the company's sales performance.

Should you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to share the completed dashboard and eager to receive your feedback.

Sincerely,

Abhishek Kumar Singh
